## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
points <- 50000
# Defining the Golden Angle
angle <- pi*sqrt(29-sqrt(149))
t <- (1:points) * angle - angle
x <- sin(t/-23)
y <- cos(t/2)*sin(t/30)
z <- rep(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), times=50)
w <- rep(c(1,2), times=250)
df <- data.frame(t, x, y, z, w)
# Have a look at the data
head(df)
```

```{r}
# Make a scatter plot of points of a spiral
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t))
p + geom_point(alpha= 0.1,size = .1,color = "black")+theme_void()

```



```{r}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t, col=factor(z)))
p + geom_point()
```
